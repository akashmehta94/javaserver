# Vectors

Using the existing class `Vector`, representing a point on the three-dimensional space and containing one field for each coordinate.

Implement methods to perform addition.

Write a method that takes another vector as argument and returns a new vector that consists of their sum.

Write a method that takes another vector as argument and returns a new vector that consists of their difference.

Write a method that takes a number and returns a new vector that is scaled according to the argument.
In order to scale a vector by a constant, it is simply required to multiply each of the coordinates of the vector by the scaling factor.

Write a method that takes another vector and returns the distance between both vectors.
The distance between two vectors can be calculated by the length of their difference.

Finally, write a method to normalise the vector and return its length.
A vector can be normalised by dividing by its length.
The length can be calculated by using the Euclidian norm which consists of the square root of the sum of the square of each of the coordinates of the vector.
